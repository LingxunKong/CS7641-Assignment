The Python scripts for Problem 1 and 2 are:

	Supervised_Learning_P1.py
	Supervised_Learning_P2.py

The script for problem 1 (Supervised_Learning_P1.py) requires an input data file:

	SL_Data.csv

Problem 2 does not require a separate input file since the dataset is genrated via an underlying function. 

Libraries used: pandas, matplotlib, time, scipy, sklearn, tensorflow (keras), numpy, nltk 

With the necessary libraries installed and the input file (for Problem 1), you can run the scripts directly.

Outputs:
	plots: all the plots shown in the lkong81-analysis.pdf 
	console printout: wall clock time and validation accuracy for each algorithm 

Due to the hyper parameter tunning, learning curve generation and cross validation, it takes a few minutes to run each script.
